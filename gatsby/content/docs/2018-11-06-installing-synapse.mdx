[Synapse](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/) is the most widely installed Matrix homeserver implementation. It is written in Python 3.

[Many guides have been written](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/#installing-synapse) explaining how to install Synapse, but there is sometimes confusion about the exact steps.

matrix.org has recommended methods for installing Synapse:

## Install from source

[INSTALL.md](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md) in the Synapse repo itself has clear instructions on installation.

## matrix-docker-ansible-deploy

Slavi has created a very useful set of Ansible playbooks which install containerised instances of multiple Matrix-ecosystem packages, the Synapse container being the centerpiece of these.

You can find the playbooks at <https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy>, and there are instructions included in the repo.

To talk about the playbooks or get installation support, talk in [#matrix-docker-ansible-deploy:devture.com](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-docker-ansible-deploy:devture.com).

It's also possible to use Docker containers without Ansible, just follow the intructions in [the Synapse Docker README](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/master/docker).

## Cloudron package

Cloudron maintains packages for [Synapse](https://cloudron.io/button/org.matrix.synapse.html) and also for [Riot](https://cloudron.io/button/im.riot.cloudronapp.html).

They are automatically kept up-to-date on the user's servers.

The package code itself can be found at https://git.cloudron.io/cloudron/matrix-synapse-app and https://git.cloudron.io/cloudron/riot-web-app
